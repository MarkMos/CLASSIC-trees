# CLASSIC-trees

#### CLASSIC-trees is still undergoing development and tests. It is not ready for production yet.

A new code to generate dark matter halo merger trees directly from running CLASS, for use with semi-analytical galaxy modeling codes.

It combines the idea of a fast and user-friendly code with modern output format. CLASSIC-trees can be used to get synthetic dark matter halo merger trees for different cosmologies in a few hours.

Features of CLASSIC-trees:
    
* Easy to use
* HDF5 output format
* Interface with CLASS for custom cosmologies
