# CLASSIC-trees

#### !!!CLASSIC-trees is still undergoing development and tests. It is not ready for production yet!!!
#### !!!This code is based on Parkinson, Cole and Helly 2008 MNRAS (383,557) (astro-ph/07081382)!!!

A new code to generate dark matter halo merger trees directly from running CLASS, for use with semi-analytical galaxy modeling codes.

It combines the idea of a fast and user-friendly code with modern output format. CLASSIC-trees can be used to get synthetic dark matter halo merger trees for different cosmologies in a few hours.

Features of CLASSIC-trees:
    
* Easy to use
* HDF5 output format as in GADGET4
* Interface with CLASS for custom cosmologies

## Installation

### Downloading
CLASSIC-trees can be downloaded by cloning the GitHub repository:

```bash
